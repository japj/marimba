This page will explain the reasoning behind Marimba

= Introduction =

Like most of the opensource/free projects, this one was started to 'scratch an itch'.
I'm a member of 3 different bands, and I found a problem area, that I wanted to write a webapplication for.


= Details =

Features that I'm interested in implementing
  * Songs archive; storing all the song title (+some more metadata) that a band can play (or once played in the past).
  * A way of creating setlist based on the archive
  * Storing rehearsal recordings of songs (for practice purposes of the musicians)
